# Grindery Nexus Schema Definitions

Schema definitions for Grindery Nexus components.

## Connectors

Connectors abstract web3 and web2 protocols into an interface of composable triggers and actions.

Schema definitions for connector apps can be found [here](connectors).

## Workflows

Workflows define a sequence of actions to be executed predicated on a trigger (an event or condition).

Workflows leverage the composability of connectors hence a workflow can include triggers and actions from multiple connectors.

Schema definitions for workflows can be found [here](workflows).
